Related skill: `agent-customization`. Load and follow **skills.md** for template and principles.

Follow the `agent-customization` guidelines to create highly effective skills.

Guide the user to create fully-featured skill with SKILL.md, resources, templates and anything relevate.

Leverage progessive context discolusure to guide the future coding agent or LLM that will read the skill with a meaningful usage of descriptions, frontmatter, file links and examples.

Search thourghly the codebase for common patterns and practices in the domain, namespace, project or folder of interest as the user specifies.

If no clear workflow emerges from the conversation, clarify with the user:

- What outcome should this skill produce?
- Workspace-scoped or personal?
- Quick checklist or full multi-step workflow?

## Output

├── references/ # Optional: documentation
├── assets/ # Optional: templates, resources
└── ... # Any additional files or directories

### Frontmatter

| Field           | Required | Constraints                                                                                                       |

| `license`       | No       | License name or reference to a bundled license file.                                                              |
| `compatibility` | No       | Max 500 characters. Indicates environment requirements (intended product, system packages, network access, etc.). |
| `metadata`      | No       | Arbitrary key-value mapping for additional metadata.                                                              |

### Body

The Markdown body after the frontmatter contains the skill instructions. There are no format restrictions. Write whatever helps agents perform the task effectively.

Recommended sections:

- Step-by-step instructions
- Examples of inputs and outputs
- Common edge cases
- Note that the agent will load this entire file once it’s decided to activate a skill. Consider splitting longer SKILL.md content into referenced files.
