# MFSE Agent Team

A multi-agent development team for coding agents. Orchestrates requirement shaping, architecture, implementation, and code review through specialized agents.

| [mfse-14-theopus](agents/mfse-14-theopus/SKILL.md) | Ultimate problem solver for hard issues |

### End-to-End

| Agent | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| [mfse-e2e](agents/mfse-e2e/SKILL.md) | Full pipeline: idea → user story → architecture → code → review |

### Supporting Skills

Skills are lightweight prompts that agents reference for specialized tasks.

| Skill | Used by | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| [mfse-user-stories-writing](skills/mfse-user-stories-writing/SKILL.md) | Facilitator | BDD user story writing with Given/When/Then templates |
| [mfse-azure-devops-cli-boards](skills/mfse-azure-devops-cli-boards/SKILL.md) | Azdo WIT | Azure DevOps Boards CLI commands for work items |

## How It Works

The team follows a structured pipeline:

1. **Facilitator** shapes raw ideas into crisp user stories
2. **Orchestrator** coordinates the implementation team
3. **Architect** designs the blueprint (contracts, boundaries, test scenarios)
4. **Coder** implements following TDD (optional — user chooses the approach)
5. **Reviewer** audits against the blueprint and conventions
6. **TheOpus** is escalated to when the team hits genuinely hard problems
